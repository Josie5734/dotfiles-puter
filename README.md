## Notes

---

these files are managed using stow to create symlinks to where they should actually be

shared/ is configs that are used on both machines

pc/ is the configs for kde and programs that are only used on the pc such as godot

laptop/ is the configs for sway and programs are only used on the laptop

because of how the file structure is set up to allow for this, the stow commands are a little annoying,
and cant really be done just from the main directory

bootstrap.sh is a bash script that automatically does all the stow commands,
including checking which machine it is on to do pc or laptop specific stuff
